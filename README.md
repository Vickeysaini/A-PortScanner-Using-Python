#  port scanning
 A port scanning is the best way to know about the victim system because it is step or footprinting and scanning and 
reconnaissance which is consider before the vitcims computer attack.
To do the information gathering and this is the show about the victim’s necessary information and weakness to perform the 
malicious attack on the victim’s system any type of malicious will be perform through the open ports and the can be perform
by any attacker. and through these open ports can be vulnerable the host system and organization.

$ python portscanner.py

Enter a remote host to scan: www.your_host_example.com
------------------------------------------------------------
Please wait, scanning remote host xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx

You can observe in the above example that the port scanner scans all the ports in the device and mentions if the ports are open or closed.

Conclusion
In this article, we have discussed a python program using the socket module to create a port scanner. This program is intended for individuals to test their own equipment for weak security, and the author will take no responsibility if it is put to any other use.
